Place your final assets here before building the demo video or uploading to GitHub:

- assets/lottie/: replace weather_placeholder.json with real Lottie JSON files (sun.json, rain.json, cloud.json, gps.json)
- assets/images/: place realistic Android mockup screenshots (720x1280)
- assets/icons/: app icons if any
- README.md in repo root explains build steps and API key placement
